# Welcome to Caesar Cipher ðŸ”’
Ceasar Cipher is a method used for encryption and decryption of a text. It is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it to communicate with his generals. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The key in this cipher is the number of positions each letter is shifted.

# History
The Caesar cipher is mentioned in works like "De Bello Gallico" ("The Gallic Wars"), a firsthand account of Julius Caesar's campaigns written by Caesar himself. In Book VII, Chapter 36, Caesar describes how he communicated with his generals using a simple letter-shifting method.

It's important to note that while the Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar and associated with him historically, the concept of letter substitution ciphers predates Caesar's use. Ancient civilizations, including the Greeks, Spartans, and Egyptians, also employed similar encryption methods. However, Caesar's use of the technique and its mention in his military campaigns have given it historical significance.

Despite its historical roots, the Caesar cipher is now considered extremely insecure and is more of a historical curiosity or a simple educational tool for introducing encryption concepts. Modern cryptography relies on much more sophisticated algorithms and mathematical principles to ensure secure communication.
