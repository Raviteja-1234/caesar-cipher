# Welcome to Caesar Cipher ðŸ”’
Ceasar Cipher is a method used for encryption and decryption of a text. It is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it to communicate with his generals. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The key in this cipher is the number of positions each letter is shifted.
